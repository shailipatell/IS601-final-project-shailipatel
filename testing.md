# Coding and Testing Journey: Overcoming Challenges and Achieving Success

Welcome to my coding and testing journey! In this README, I'll walk you through my experiences, challenges, and triumphs as I pursue a Master's in Computer Science and dive deep into the world of technology.

## Quality Assurance (QA) Process

Quality Assurance (QA) is the bedrock of any successful project. Throughout my journey, I've come to understand the vital importance of engaging in QA reviews before finalizing any aspect of my work. This meticulous process has helped me refine my skills in identifying potential issues and ensuring top-notch quality in everything I do.

## Overcoming Challenges

While my journey has been filled with exciting victories, it hasn't been without its fair share of challenges. Recently, I encountered two significant hurdles that put my problem-solving abilities to the test:

### GitHub Actions Integration for Playwright Tests and Deployment

Integrating Playwright tests with GitHub Actions was a task that presented unexpected complexities. I encountered roadblocks that required thorough debugging and careful adjustments. Each challenge became an opportunity for growth, as I documented my troubleshooting process and gained a deeper understanding of automation and CI/CD pipelines.

### Mailchimp and GDPR Compliance

Navigating the integration of Mailchimp while ensuring compliance with GDPR regulations was a challenging endeavor. I immersed myself in research, watching informative videos and gathering insights to unravel the intricacies of this process. The journey demanded patience and persistence, but I can now confidently integrate Mailchimp while adhering to GDPR guidelines.

## Celebrating Success

Through perseverance and dedication, I've managed to conquer the obstacles that once seemed insurmountable. With the GitHub Actions challenges overcome and a firm grasp on Mailchimp integration and GDPR compliance, my coding and testing process has grown stronger and more resilient than ever.

## A Future Driven by Passion

As I continue my academic pursuits and explore the vast landscape of computer science, my passion remains the driving force behind my journey. The challenges I've faced have only fueled my curiosity and determination to remain at the forefront of technological innovation. With a solid foundation and a newfound skill set, I eagerly anticipate the exciting opportunities that lie ahead.

## Conclusion

My journey in the world of computer science has been marked by growth, perseverance, and achievement. The QA process has become second nature, and I've overcome complex challenges related to GitHub Actions and compliance intricacies. As I move forward, my passion for technology burns brighter than ever, propelling me to excel and make meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving field of computer science.

Thank you for joining me on this journey!
